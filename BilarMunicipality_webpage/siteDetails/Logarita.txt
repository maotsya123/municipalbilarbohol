Site: Logarita Swimming Pool
Details:
Logarita Swimming Pool is located at Bilar town inside the Rajah Sikatuna National Park. The pool is fed by the Logarita Spring 
which is known for its fresh, clean and cool water. The water at the often moss-covered pool is safe for drinking and far 
healthier for it is without chemicals. The moss does not make it dirty but instead provides oxygen to the water which is 
refreshingly cool. It is situated on a clearing surrounded by tall Mahogany and other hardwood trees. Small native 
thatched cottages are provided to give shade to the bathers. The place is a favorite nook of the local folks and 
year after year plays host to foreign visitors who come to the park for eco-tours and birding activities.
