Site: Mahogany Man-made Forest
Details:
The Mahogany Man-Made Forest is a two-kilometer stretch of densely planted Mahogany trees located in Bilar town. Before and after 
this man-made forest are the naturally grown forests of Loboc and Bilar which are thick with a kaleidoscope of green foliage, of 
different species of trees and giant ferns lining the road. The man-made forest stands out because of the uniformity in height 
of the big trees, the spread of its branches, thickness and design of leaves. Seedlings abound around the older trees. Trunks, 
some thick and others just a few months old, grow resplendently straight up towards the sky which is obscured by the branches 
and the thick leaves. The forest is part of the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape which commuters have to pass thru on their 
way to Carmen where the famous Chocolate Hills are found.Foreign visitors finds the place so attractive that they, often 
than not, stop to take pictures of the forest.
