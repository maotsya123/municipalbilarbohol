		<h3> Bilar is an interior town northeast of Loboc. This town used to occupy a big area and included what are now known as municipalities of Sevilla, Batuan and Carmen. The term bilar is a native word from the infinitive nagbilad. During the Spanish regime, the Spaniards, in their effort to spread Christianity, toured the interior villages and somehow chanced to pass a plateau where a group of women were drying palay.When the women were asked as to the name of the place, the immediate reply was nagbilad, meaning drying, thinking that the foreigners were asking their activity. The Spaniards shorten the term to bilad and later on to bilar due to the difficulty in pronouncing the term. By virtue of a royal decree, the name Bilar was adopted as the official name of the municipality.
